Select all the correct statements from the below code:
public final class A {
	public void m1() {				// statement 1
		...
	}
}
public class B extends A {				// statement 2
}
public class C {
	public void m2() {
		...
	}
}
public class D extends C {
	public final void m2() {			// statement 3
		final int value = 2;
		final int[] valueArr = {2, 3, 4};
		final String text1 = "Cat on the wall";
		String text2 = text1;			// statement 4
		String text3 =  "Dog in the pool";
		text1 = text3;				// statement 5
		valueArr[1] = value;			// statement 6
	}
}
Statement 1 will result in a compilation error. Since class A is marked as final all its methods must also be marked as final so that its subclasses cannot modify the method implementation by overriding.
In statement 2, will result in compilation error. Since class A is declared as final it cannot be extended by class B.
In statement 3, method m2 of class D overrides the implementation provided in m2 of class C. Since m2 in class C is not declared final, m2 of class D also should not be declared final.
Statement 4 will result in a compilation error. Since text1 is declared as final it cannot be used in an any assignment statement.
Statement 5 will result in a compilation error.
Statement 6 will result in a compilation error.

Ans :-

In statement 2, will result in compilation error. Since class A is declared as final it cannot be extended by class B.

Statement 5 will result in a compilation error.
