In Java, when we do not want a class to ever have subclasses, we declare that class as final.

In Java we have many final classes. For example, like the String and all the wrapper classes like Integer, Float etc.

Select all the correct statements given below:

class A {} // statement 1
class final B extends A {} // statement 2
Statement 2 will result in compilation error. Since class A is not marked as final, class B which extends class A, cannot mark itself as final.
Object class declared in java.lang package, is a good example of final class.
Below is a valid code:
public final interface A {
}
We declare a class as final, when we do not want someone to change its implementation by subclassing it.
