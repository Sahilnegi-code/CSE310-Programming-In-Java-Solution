Method overloading is a feature which allows multiple methods with same name and different parameters in the same class.

Method overriding is a feature where we specialize (or modify) a method behaviour which is already present in the superclass. This takes places only when we have a class extending another class.

Select all the correct statements from the below code:
class A {
	public void printMe(int number) { // statement 1 
		System.out.println(number);
	}
	public void printMe(boolean flag) { // statement 2 
		System.out.println(flag);
	}
	public void printMe(int number, boolean flag) { // statement 3 
		System.out.println(number + " : " + flag);
	}
}
class B extends A {
	public void printMe(int number) { // statement 4 
		System.out.println("The double of " + number + " is : " + (number * 2));
	}
}
Statements 1, 2 and 3 in class A contain overloaded versions of method printMe.
Statements 1, 2 and 3 in class A contain overridden versions of method printMe.
The method in statement 4, overrides the method declared in statement 2.
The method in statement 4, overrides the method declared in statement 1.
The method declaration in statement 3 has more parameters than the methods declared in statements 1 and 2, hence it will not be considered as a overloaded version of printMe.

Ans :-

Statements 1, 2 and 3 in class A contain overloaded versions of method printMe.

The method in statement 4, overrides the method declared in statement 1.
